=============================================================================

Module "A"         (component BitIO)
   - A_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and returned.
                If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).
                This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "B"         (component BitIO)
   - B_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and returned.
                If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).
                This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "C"         (component BitIO)
   - C_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and returned.
                If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).
                This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "D"         (component BitIO)
   - D_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and returned.
                If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).
                This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "E"         (component BitIO)
   - E_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and returned.
                If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).
                This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - E_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - E_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only if 
                the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - E_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "Erro"      (component BitIO)
   - Erro_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Erro_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or 
                a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Erro_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Erro_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "S"         (component BitIO)
   - S_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and returned.
                If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).
                This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - S_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a 
                register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - S_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only if 
                the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - S_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "I"         (component BitIO)
   - I_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and returned.
                If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).
                This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "Cpu"       (component MC9S12C32_80)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_SetWaitMode -Set low power mode - Wait mode.  For more information about the wait mode see documentation of this CPU.  
                Release from Wait mode: Reset or interrupt
   - Cpu_SetStopMode -Set low power mode - Stop mode.  For more information about the stop mode see documentation of this CPU.
